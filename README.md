### 🚧 🚀 A Note on the Future
**GalaxyWars is just getting started.**
While this v1.0 release establishes our core engine, it is only the foundation. Our roadmap includes massive expansions aimed at bringing the authentic feel of the **world's most popular space opera franchise** to your server.

Future updates are already in development to introduce:
* **Iconic Weaponry:** Fully functional plasma swords (with ignition mechanics) and blaster combat.
* **Expanded Abilities:** Advanced powers like Choke, Lightning, Sword Throw, and Mind Tricks.
* **Deep Gameplay:** Faction systems (Light vs Dark), open-world roleplay modes, and intricate leveling trees.
* **Total Customization:** Tools for server owners to tailor every aspect of the galaxy to their needs.

*Stay tuned. The galaxy is expanding.*
